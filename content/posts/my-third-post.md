# Huffman Coding Explained

> "In the world of entropy, Huffman shows us that even the longest stories deserve the shortest code."

## What is Huffman Coding?

### Definition
Huffman Coding is a **lossless data compression algorithm**. It reduces the size of files by using **shorter codes for more frequent characters** and **longer codes for less frequent ones**.

Huffman coding involves two steps:
1. **Encoding** the original data.
2. **Decoding** it back to the original form after transmission or storage.

---

## Why Do We Use Huffman Coding?

We use Huffman Coding to:

- ‚úÖ Reduce file sizes  
- ‚úÖ Save memory or storage  
- ‚úÖ Transmit data faster  
- ‚úÖ Compress text, images, audio, and more  

It helps send and store information **more efficiently**.

## Advantages of Huffman Coding

1. **Lossless Compression** ‚Äì No data is lost during compression.  
2. **Efficient for Text** ‚Äì Works well when some characters appear more frequently.  
3. **Simple & Fast** ‚Äì Easy to implement and runs quickly.  
4. **Widely Used** ‚Äì Used in ZIP, JPEG, MP3, PNG, and more.

---

## Disadvantages of Huffman Coding

1. ‚ùå Not effective if all characters occur with equal frequency.  
2. ‚ùå Requires a frequency table, which adds overhead.  
3. ‚ùå Slower for real-time compression due to tree construction.  
4. ‚ùå Not flexible for changing data ‚Äî needs a new tree if data changes.

## Huffman Coding in Python (with Explanation)

### Code

```python
import heapq
from collections import Counter, namedtuple

class Node(namedtuple("Node", ["char", "freq", "left", "right"])):
    def __lt__(self, other): 
        return self.freq < other.freq

def build_huffman_tree(text):
    freq = Counter(text)
    heap = [Node(ch, freq, None, None) for ch, freq in freq.items()]
    heapq.heapify(heap)

    while len(heap) > 1:
        left = heapq.heappop(heap)
        right = heapq.heappop(heap)
        merged = Node(None, left.freq + right.freq, left, right)
        heapq.heappush(heap, merged)

    return heap[0]

def make_codes(node, prefix="", codebook={}):
    if node.char is not None:
        codebook[node.char] = prefix
    else:
        make_codes(node.left, prefix + "0", codebook)
        make_codes(node.right, prefix + "1", codebook)

    return codebook

text = "My name is Khansa"
tree = build_huffman_tree(text)
codes = make_codes(tree)

print("Huffman Codes:", codes)
```

### Explanation

#### `import heapq` and `from collections...`
- `heapq`: For priority queue (min-heap).
- `Counter`: Counts frequency of characters.
- `namedtuple`: Makes tree nodes readable.

#### `class Node...`
Defines nodes used in the Huffman Tree.  
`__lt__` lets Python compare nodes by frequency for use in a heap.

#### `def build_huffman_tree(text):`
1. Counts character frequencies.
2. Pushes all characters into a min-heap.
3. Repeatedly merges lowest-frequency pairs until one tree remains.

#### `def make_codes(node, prefix="", codebook={}):`
1. Recursively traverses the tree.
2. Appends `'0'` when going left, `'1'` when going right.
3. Stores codes in the dictionary once a leaf (character) is reached.

#### `text = "My name is Khansa"`
Runs the Huffman coding process on a sample string and prints the result.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Huffman Coding is a smart way to **compress data without losing information**. It's widely used in compression, media formats, and telecommunications. Understanding how it works helps you appreciate how efficiently computers handle data.
